## Open vs Closed-source LLMs - Comparison

### Closed-source LLM - Advantages
- _**No Hardware Requirements**_: Usually accessed from accessible UIs through the internet
- _**No / Limited Expertise Requirements**_: Does not require high technical expertise
- _**Security features managed by provider**_: Reduced risk of errors
- _**Performance**_: On average, currently available closed-source do slightly better than open-source on charts 

### Closed-source LLM - Disadvantages
- _**Privacy and Security Risks**_: Any data you input is being sent to the external server / provider, and there is a risk of data being sent to third parties
- _**Requires Internet Connection**_: As opposed to running locally, closed-source LLMs require internet connection
- _**Less Adaptable and Customisable**_: Less flexibility to personalise / adapt, works with specific applications and workflows, limited control / limited personalisation options
- _**Costs**_: Commonly involves recurring fees to access the service
- _**Dependence on Provider**_: Long-term dependence on the provider
- _**Bias and Censorship**_: Defined by provider, no control over it
- _**Network Latency**_: Response might be slower since data is transmitted over the network

### Open-source LLM - Advantages
- _**Data Privacy**_: NO data is leaving your local systems, therefore secure, confidential and not shared with third parties
- _**Performance**_: On average, currently available closed-source do slightly better than open-source on charts 
- _**Adaptable and Customisable**_: Full control, e.g. over workflow, personalisation, UI...
- _**No Dependence on Provider**_: Long-term control of the model, application, data, etc.
- _**No Bias or Censorship**_: Control over security measures implemented
- _**Transparency**_: You are in control of the model and features applied
- _**Costs**_: Free, but ONLY if run locally without deploying (personal use)
- _**No Internet Connection & No Network Latency**_: ONLY if run locally without deploying (personal use)

### Open-source LLM - Disadvantages
- _**Hardware Requirements**_: Requires a relatively powerful machine to run
- _**Performance**_: On average, currently available closed-source do slightly better than open-source on charts 
- _**Costs**_: Higher if you want to deploy and make it available to other users
- _**Technical Knowledge**_: Requires expertise to build / maintain. 
- _**Security and Censorship Implemented Manually**_: Security and Censorship features need to be implemented manually, introducing risk of errors, especially if the model will be distributed at larger scale
